* Org-HTML-Slideshow                                                  :slide:

Make slides from Emacs Org-Mode!

** Making Slides                                                      :slide:

Org-Mode headlines with the =:slide:= tag will become slides.

** Headlines Don't Have to be Slides

This section doesn't have a =:slide:= tag, so it will *not* become a slide, although it is still part of the exported HTML document.

** Use Lists For Bullets                                              :slide:

- Use Org-Mode lists for bullet points
- You can make nested bullet lists
  - With sub-lists
  - Like this

** Or Low-Level Headings                                              :slide:

**** By default
***** Org-Mode headings below level 3
****** Become bullets
****** Meaning they *cannot* be slides
**** This is configurable
***** See [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-options.html][Export Options in the Org-Mode manual]]

** Slides Can Be Nested                                               :slide:

You can use the structure of the Org-Mode document to group your slides.

For example, this slide is a *level-2* Org-Mode heading.

*** Slide Headings Can Be Nested                                      :slide:

This slide is a *level-3* Org-Mode heading, inside the previous one.

* Presenter Notes                                                     :slide:

- Slides can have presenter notes
- Add a sub-heading with the =:notes:= tag
  
** A Slide with Notes                                                 :slide:

- This slide has notes
- Notes are only visible to presenter

*** Notes                                                             :notes:

- Presenter notes for this slide
- Not displayed as part of the slide
- Displayed in Presenter Preview window
- Only one =:notes:= section per slide allowed

* Source Code                                                         :slide:

Use =begin_src/end_src= blocks to include source code.

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn example []
    (println "This is sample source code."))
#+end_src

** Syntax Highlighting                                                :slide:

- Org-Mode HTML export uses [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Htmlize][htmlize.el]]
- Code in exported HTML will match your current Emacs theme
  - Choose a theme that looks good on a projector!

** Syntax Highlighting with CSS Classes                               :slide:

- Set the Emacs variable 
  - =org-export-htmlize-output-type= 
  - to the symbol =css=
  - (Does not work as a buffer-local variable)
- Htmlize.el will add SPAN tags with CSS classes
  - Named for each font face, e.g. =org-comment=
- Examine HTML output to see class names
- Add CSS styles to set colors

* Images                                                              :slide:

- Slides can contain images
  - Any file type a browser can display
- See also these Emacs variables:
  - =org-export-html-inline-images=
  - =org-export-html-inline-image-extensions=
    - Controls which file types get exported
- See [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Images-in-HTML-export.html][Images in HTML Export in the Org-Mode manual]].

** Slide with Image                                                   :slide:

Make a =file:= link with the path to the image and no link text.

[[file:example-image.svg]]

This example image is public-domain [[http://openclipart.org/detail/165554/geodesic_dome-by-yoderj][clip art by Josiah / yoderj]].

** Image In First Column                                      :slide:two_col:

[[file:example-image.svg]]

- Elements can be positioned on the page according to the slide's styling
- This example image is public-domain [[http://openclipart.org/detail/165554/geodesic_dome-by-yoderj][clip art by Josiah / yoderj]].

* Tables                                                              :slide:

#+CAPTION: An example table
| Type of Example                        | Number of examples | 
|----------------------------------------+--------------------| 
| Tables                                 | 1                  | 
| Images                                 | 2                  | 
| Styling                                | 1                  | 
| Bullets                                | 21                 | 

- Tables have some default styles

* Animation                                            :animate:appear:slide:
- Mark a slide with the =animated= tag
- And an animation tag
- Currently only =appear= is supported
  - Sub-bullets are animated, too

** Todos                                                              :notes:

- Perhaps should work with each element?

* Styling                                                             :slide:

- Use CSS styles to control appearance of slides
- Extra tags on a slide become extra CSS classes on its HTML

** Org-Mode Tag as CSS Class                          :slide:blue_background:

- This slide has the =:blue_background:= tag
  - Which is a class defined in =projection.css=
- Make up your own tags
  - Add them to the CSS file

* Placing Stylesheets/JavaScript                                      :slide:

Include the stylesheets and JavaScript at the *bottom* of your Org-Mode file.

They must go at the bottom because the Google Closure Library does not support an on-DOM-ready event. See the [[http://groups.google.com/group/closure-library-discuss/browse_thread/thread/1beecbb5d6afcb41/075c536259653946][Closure mailing list discussion]] for an explanation.

** Warning About Hidden Headlines                                     :slide:

Stylesheets and JavaScript will *not* be loaded if the *last* headline in your Org-Mode file is hidden by any of:

- =COMMENT= at the start of the heading
- =#+COMMENT= at the start of the line
- =:noexport:= tag, or missing =:export:= tag

See [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Comment-lines.html][Comment lines]] and [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Selective-export.html][Selective export]] in the Org-Mode manual for details.

** The End                                                            :slide:

Sometimes it's safest to add an "empty" heading at the end of your document to make sure the stylesheets and JavaScript are included.
